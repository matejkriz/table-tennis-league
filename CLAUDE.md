# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A local-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking table tennis league ratings using the STR (Skill-based Team Ranking) system. Built with React, TanStack Router, and Evolu for local-first data synchronization.

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
yarn dev              # Start development server (Vite)
yarn build            # Type-check with tsc and build for production
yarn preview          # Preview production build locally
```

### Linting and Quality
```bash
yarn lint             # Run ESLint on the codebase
```

### Testing
```bash
yarn test             # Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:ui          # Run tests with Vitest UI
yarn test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Utilities
```bash
yarn clean                    # Remove node_modules, dist, and build artifacts
yarn generate-pwa-assets      # Generate PWA icons and assets
```

## Architecture

### Data Layer - Evolu

The application uses **Evolu** (a local-first database framework) for data persistence and synchronization:

- **Schema definition**: `src/evolu/client.ts` defines the database schema with three tables:
  - `player`: Player information with name and initial rating
  - `match`: Match records linking two players with a winner and timestamp
  - `_uiPreference`: Local-only UI state (underscore prefix means not synced across devices)

- **Authentication**: Uses `localAuth` from `@evolu/react-web` to manage owner profiles. The database name includes the owner ID for multi-profile support.

- **Queries**: Pre-defined queries (`playersQuery`, `matchesQuery`, `uiPreferencesQuery`) are created using `evolu.createQuery()` and consumed via the `useQuery()` hook.

- **Data operations**: Use `insert()` and `update()` methods from `useEvolu()` hook. All writes go through Evolu's validation system with typed schemas.

- **Type safety**: Evolu provides strong typing with branded types (`PlayerId`, `MatchId`, etc.) and validation schemas (`NonEmptyTrimmedString100`, `NonNegativeNumber`, etc.).

### Rating System

The STR rating system is implemented in `src/hooks/useLeagueData.ts`:

- **K-factor**: Set to `16` (constant `K_FACTOR`)
- **Rating calculation**: Uses standard Elo formula with expected score calculation
- **Match processing**: All matches are sorted by `playedAt` timestamp and processed sequentially to compute rating deltas
- **Output**: Returns `LeagueData` object containing players, matches with rating details, and current ranking

The `useLeagueData` hook is the single source of truth for all rating computations and should be used whenever rating data is needed.

### Routing

Uses **TanStack Router** with file-based routing:

- Route files are in `src/routes/`
- `routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by `@tanstack/router-plugin/vite`
- Root route (`__root.tsx`) wraps the app in `EvoluProvider` and `Suspense`
- Current routes:
  - `/` (index.tsx): Main dashboard with player management, match recording, ranking, and history
  - `/match` (match.tsx): Standalone match recording page
  - `/stats` (stats.tsx): Standalone statistics and leaderboard page

### UI Components

Component patterns used throughout:

- **CollapsibleSection**: Reusable collapsible container that persists open/closed state in Evolu's `_uiPreference` table using the `useCollapsibleState` hook
- **Form handling**: Forms use Evolu's type validation with `formatTypeError()` to display user-friendly error messages
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes with custom theme color `#F7931A` (orange) as the primary accent
- **Icons**: `@tabler/icons-react` for all icons

### State Management

- **Server state**: Managed entirely through Evolu queries (`useQuery()`)
- **UI state (persisted)**: Stored in Evolu's `_uiPreference` table for collapsible sections
- **Local form state**: React's `useState()` for form inputs and temporary UI state

## Key Technical Details

### Evolu Data Flow

1. All database mutations use typed schemas with built-in validation
2. Queries are reactive - components re-render when underlying data changes
3. The `_uiPreference` table (underscore prefix) stores local-only data that doesn't sync
4. Use `onComplete` callback in insert/update operations for post-mutation actions (e.g., resetting forms)

### Type Safety

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Evolu provides branded types (e.g., `PlayerId`, `MatchId`) that prevent mixing different ID types
- Query result types are inferred from the schema (e.g., `PlayerRow`, `MatchRow`)
- Use `$narrowType<>()` in queries to refine types when filtering out nullable fields

### PWA Configuration

- Service worker registration type: `autoUpdate`
- Workbox handles caching of all assets including `.wasm` files (required for SQLite WebAssembly)
- Manifest defined in `vite.config.ts`
- Assets generated from `pwa-assets.config.ts`

### Vite Configuration

Notable optimizeDeps exclusions:
- `@evolu/sqlite-wasm`: SQLite WebAssembly module
- `kysely`: SQL query builder (peer dependency of Evolu)
- `@evolu/react-web`: Evolu React bindings

These are excluded to avoid Vite's dependency pre-bundling which can cause issues with WebAssembly modules.

### Testing Setup

The project uses **Vitest** with **React Testing Library** for testing:

- **Test framework**: Vitest (compatible with Vite configuration)
- **Component testing**: React Testing Library
- **IndexedDB mock**: `fake-indexeddb` polyfills IndexedDB for Evolu in tests
- **Test files**: Located alongside source files with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension

**Key testing considerations:**

- **Evolu mocking**: Test files mock the Evolu client module before imports to prevent WebWorker initialization in jsdom
- **Mock pattern**: Each test file includes `vi.mock("../evolu/client")` at the top with mocked hooks (`useEvolu`, `useQuery`, etc.)
- **Test setup**: Global setup in `src/test/setup.ts` includes fake-indexeddb and @testing-library/jest-dom matchers

**Coverage:**
- Rating calculation logic (`useLeagueData.ts`): 11 tests covering K-factor, Elo formula, ranking, and edge cases
- Critical components: `AddPlayerForm`, `MatchRecorder`, `CollapsibleSection`
- Total: 61 tests across 4 test files

Run tests in watch mode during development for instant feedback on changes.

## Development Guidelines

### Working with Evolu

- Always use the pre-defined queries (`playersQuery`, `matchesQuery`, etc.) rather than writing raw SQL
- For mutations, use the typed schema objects - Evolu will validate at runtime
- Handle validation errors using `formatTypeError()` for consistent error messages
- Remember that `_uiPreference` table is local-only (not synced)

### Adding New Features

- For new database tables, update the schema in `src/evolu/client.ts`
- Create typed queries using `evolu.createQuery()`
- Export branded ID types (e.g., `export const FooId = Evolu.id("Foo")`)
- Use TanStack Router's file-based routing for new pages
- Follow existing component patterns for consistency (especially CollapsibleSection for grouping content)
- Write tests for new business logic and critical components (place `.test.ts` files alongside source files)

### Styling Conventions

- Use Tailwind utility classes directly in components
- Primary accent color: `#F7931A` (orange)
- Background: `#fafafa` (very light gray)
- Text: `black` with opacity variants for hierarchy (`black/60`, `black/40`, etc.)
- Rounded corners: typically `rounded-xl` or `rounded-full` for buttons
- Consistent spacing: use the Tailwind scale (`p-4`, `p-5`, `p-6`, etc.)
